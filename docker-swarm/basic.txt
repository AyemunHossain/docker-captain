** Simply Docker Swarm is mainly used to deploy, scale, and manage the containers and nodes which are available in the cluster.

There are two types of nodes in Docker Swarm:
    1. Manager node: Carries out and oversees cluster-level duties. 
    2. Worker node: Receives and completes the tasks set by the manager node.


*** By default docker swarm is not enabled. To enable docker swarm we need to run the following command:**
```docker swarm init```

*** Configuring docker swarm on server can needed the advertise ip option:
  docker swarm init --advertise-addr <ip>

*** To check the status of the swarm we can run the following command:**
```docker info```

*** To add worker or manager swarm node we can run the following command:**
```docker swarm join-token manager```
```docker swarm join-token worker```
   
   > These will return the command to add the node to the swarm.


*** You can updates roles of your worker node 
    docker node update --role manager node2



*** So then we will create service
*** Then service will distribute the task over nodes
