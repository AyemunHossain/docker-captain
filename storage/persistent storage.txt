key points:

1. Mount: The mount flag is used to mention the kind of persistence we require. =( It could be bind, tmpfs, or volume)

            * bind: It is used to mount a file or directory from the host machine to the container. 
                     -> It allows you to access files and directories from the host within the container.
                     -> It is used to share files between the host and the container.

                     docker run -d -p 5002:5000 --name container2 --mount type=volume, source="my_volume", target=/app/docker_bind create_file_py_image
                     

            * tmpfs: It is used to mount a temporary file system inside the container.
                     -> It is used to store temporary files.
                     -> It is stored in the host machine’s memory.

            * volume: It is used to mount a volume inside the container.
                     -> It is used to store data in a separate location from the container.
                     -> It is stored in the host machine’s file system.

2. Volume: The volume flag is used to mention the name of the volume we want to create.
3. Volume-driver: The volume-driver flag is used to mention the driver we want to use for the volume.
4. Volume-opt: The volume-opt flag is used to mention the options we want to use for the volume.

















### Practice: 

1. Bind:
