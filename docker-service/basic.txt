*** Services are like groups of containers:

        When you're building a backend application, you often have different parts or microservices that need to work together, 
        like a web server, a database, and maybe a cache. In Docker, a "service" is like a group of containers that work together 
        as a team to provide a part of your application's functionality.

** Raft Algorithm: Docker swarm uses this to manage the nodes.



Create a sevice: 
        docker service create --name web nginx

List services:
        docker service ls

Inspect a service:
        docker service inspect web

create a service under a network: 
        docker service create --name psql --network mydrupal -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypass postgres
