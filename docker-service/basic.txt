*** Services are like groups of containers:

        When you're building a backend application, you often have different parts or microservices that need to work together, 
        like a web server, a database, and maybe a cache. In Docker, a "service" is like a group of containers that work together 
        as a team to provide a part of your application's functionality.

** Raft Algorithm: Docker swarm uses this to manage the nodes.
