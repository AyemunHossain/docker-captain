1. Docker Image: Docker image is the source of Docker container.
2. Docker container: Docker container is the running state of Docker image.
4. Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
5. Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories.
6. Docker Swarm: Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers.
7. Docker Machine: Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts.
8. Docker Registry: A Docker registry is a hosted registry server that can hold Docker Images. 
9. Docker Engine: Docker Engine is a client-server application with these major components:
    - A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the dockerd command).
    - A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.
    - A command line interface (CLI) client (the docker command).
10. Docker Client: The Docker client is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. 
11. Docker Daemon: The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
