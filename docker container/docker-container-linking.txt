* Docker linking is a legacy feature of Docker that may eventually be deprecated. It is recommended to use Docker networks instead.

## Docker networks
    1. Create a network
        docker network create my-network
    2. Run a container in the network
        docker run -d --name my-nginx --network my-network nginx
    3. Run another container in the network
        docker run -d --name my-httpd --network my-network httpd
    4. Inspect the network
        docker network inspect my-network
    
    
    *** You can also connect a running container to a network
        docker network connect my-network my-redis
